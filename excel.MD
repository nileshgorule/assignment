1.What is a function in Excel?<br>
 ans : <br> 
1.In excel there is already predefine formulas that we can perform
some specific  caluclation using values, called arguments in a particular syntax or structure.<br>
  
2.In most used functions is SUM,COUNT,CONCATENATE,AVERAGE,IF,LEN,VLOOKUP,HLOOKUP,MAX EAND MANY MORE....<br>
 
 
2. How do you start a function in Excel?<br>
ANS :<br>
STEP 1 :
first i will add some data in excel sheet then perform.<br>
 
STEP 2 : formulas are always starts with an sign(=).<br>
 
STEP 3 : EXAMPLE <br>
HERE I will be used average function so that we need to type 

=AVERAGE(C2:C4)

3.What is the purpose of using functions in Excel?<br>
 
in excel we can put larger data and then we need to see some persons data or employee data or else in hospital there are larger data so we cannot look entire excel sheet so that we can perform there functions that will help to get data, calculate employees salary or  in see hospital patient names etc.
so,  in that case we can perform function and get emplyee data or petient data.

4.What is the difference between a function and a formula in Excel? <br>
 
1. functions are predefine calculation that perform particular or specific operation,based on specified arguments and values,functions is already available in excel that can we insert into a formula.<br>
 
2. formula is that expression that we caluculate values in cell or range of cells defining by the user .<br>
 
5. How can you enter a function manually in a cell?

2. The full form of VLOOKUP is "Vertical Lookup." It's called "vertical" because it searches for a value vertically in a specific column within a table or range of data and retrieves a corresponding value from a different column within the same row. VLOOKUP is a commonly used function in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets for tasks involving data lookup and retrieval.

3.syntax:
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
	- "lookup value":The value you want to find in the first column of the table_array.
	- "table array":The range of cells that contains the data you want to search in.
	- "col_index_num":The column number from which you want to retrieve the result (the first column in the table_array is 1, the second column is 2, and so on).
	- "[range_lookup]":This parameter is optional. If set to TRUE (or omitted), it assumes an approximate match and looks for the closest match. If set to FALSE, 	   it searches for an exact match.
4. Example
 step 1:=VLOOKUP(102, A2:C5, 3, FALSE)
 step 2: here,lookup value is 102 A2:C5 is the table_array containing the data.3 is the col_index_num to retrieve the department.FALSE indicates an exact match.

20.What does the HLOOKUP function do, and when is it used?
ans: 
1. HLOOKUP is a function in spreadsheet software, like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, used to search for a specific value in the first row of a table or range and return a corresponding value from a specified row below.

2.It is typed =SUMIF:
3. syntax: =SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])
4.steps to used: 
	- Select the cell
	- Type =SUMIF()
	- Specify the range for the condition like  B2:B10 (the Type 1 values), 
	- Specify the criteria (the cell E3, which has the value "type value here "),
	- Specify the range for the sum C2:C10 (the Total values),
	- Hit enter.
5. here The [sum_range] is optional.

If not specified, the function calculates the sum of the same range as the condition.

3.example =ROUND(2.15, 1)

Rounds 2.15 to one decimal place

result is 2.2

29.How do you use the CONCATENATE function to join text from multiple cells?
ans:
1.syntax:
  =CONCAT(cell1, delimiter, cell2)
2 with the above  given syntax we can use CONCAT function.
3	- select BLANK celL
	- type =CONCAT("select cell",
	- add a comma(,)
	- FOR SPACE we can add quatation marks to create a delimeter(" ")
